RPi-aquarium
============
This is the code for my raspberry pi controled aquarium. For this I use 2 mosfets to controll the fish feeder and the strip of lights. The strip of lights is connected on the only HW PWM pin on RPi.

Implemented functions:<br>
-light controlled based on sun's raising and fallig.<br>
-automatic fish feeder.<br>
